# weather-and-alert-system-automation
This n8n workflow fetches Lahoreâ€™s real-time weather from the OpenWeather API and checks conditions like rain or clear skies. Using IF nodes, it triggers alerts when criteria are met. Notifications are sent via Slack (or other channels), creating an automated weather monitoring and alert system.
